However, whenever any area is closed down or given restrictions it causes a consequential surge in traffic elsewhere and this leads inevitably to greater congestion and air pollution as all motor vehicles, be they cars, taxis or buses, idle away. \nThe rationale of the initiative �to reduce congestion, improve air quality and make it easier and safer for residents to walk and cycle� is simply a chimera: it sounds good but will achieve nothing. \nOne of the facts that most city planners seem to ignore is the importance of flowing traffic. As soon as traffic is reduced or removed it facilitates other street crimes, such as mugging, because the life blood is not running through the area. No doubt the trial will go ahead and the City of \nWestminster will spend a lot of unnecessary money on modifying the roads, creating signage etc, all frankly for no good reason. \nThe amount of unnecessary expenditure that has already taken place on restructuring the roads, increasing pavements and providing cycle lanes must be an eye watering figure. Clearly the City of Westminster has a responsibility to make things as safe as possible for everyone.

If the public realm is not addressed holistically, civic life in Connaught Village will continue to not fulfil its potential, and the area will continue to be a way through rather than a destination. Should the pedestrian realm be augmented with widened pavements, reduced on-street parking, and lots of suds planting + a few new trees, then opportunity for businesses, residents and visitors in the area increase exponentially. The option of temporal traffic closure as at Motcomb Street should be explored.

The traffic is already bad because of this and the buses will be even slower - many people are loath to catch the tube due to Covid-19 germs already. The council seems to be ignoring the fact we are in the midst of a pandemic, many of us have lost relatives and friends, work issues, financial issues and this is grotesque behaviour to sneak in a scheme to help the residents of the Hyde Park Estate. \nOn the Next Door app, one of their residents said it was a good thing as it would push prices up. Really? We need more affordable action not more people being outpaced when homelessness is set to rise 33% Even more outrageously and egragoously, the council used a delivery service just three weeks before the deadline to object - many of my neighbours did NOT receive them and are therefore I would suggest that you consider residents views.

I also recognise that in order to achieve this I will have to accept some inconvenience to me as a driver of having restricted entry and exit points around the estate, making journey times longer, and I am prepared to do this. However, the current proposal has a number of serious flaws which make it unacceptable to me in its current form. \n1) I live in Somers Crescent in the Northern sector of the three way division of the Estate. The current plan allows only one way out of the Estate for this sector � via Southwick Street, which goes against its overall statement that �each area will have multiple routes in and out�. That route is currently congested and there are frequent backups of traffic in Southwick Street waiting to exit into Sussex Gardens. There are cars parked on both sides of the street, a large cycle rack and a large garage entrance on this street making it difficult for two way traffic to move easily. And this is before making it the only route out of the estate for all of the Northern sector. This is unacceptable. \n2) My house in Somers Crescent has a private garage underneath the house which is accessed only from Southwick Street (in the Northern Sector) and exited only in Radnor Place (in the Western sector) which is left turn only into Sussex Gardens. This means that when I exit the garage I cannot drive to the front of my house to park or pick up people or large items without driving all around the perimeter of the entire area and re-entering the Estate via Burwood Place or Southwick Street. This is ridiculous and unacceptable and goes against the proposal�s statement that �all residents can still drive to and park outside their homes.� \n3) There is only one entrance into Somers Crescent (from Hyde Park Crescent) meaning that every time I drive to the front of my house I will have to do a three point turn in the street to get out again. Also unacceptable. \n4) There is also a potential rat run that is still left open which affects the Northern sector. Vehicles on the Edgware Road wanting to turn into Sussex Gardens either just to avoid congestion on the Edgware Road or to ultimately access the Marylebone Road eastbound, could drive into the Estate at Burwood Place and exit into Sussex Gardens via Southwick Street, using the current rat run on Hyde Park Crescent. No improvement at all to the current situation. \n5) Points 1 � 3 above could possibly be ameliorated by extending the Northern sector westwards to Sussex Place and opening up the entry/exit point at Radnor Place/Sussex Gardens. This would mean that Radnor Place, Southwick Place, Radnor Mews and Gloucester Square (north side) would be in the Northern sector.","hpe":true,"icon":"red"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.1699,51.51559],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.16883,51.51482],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"comments2":"","status":"Strongly \nnegative","hpe":true,"icon":"red","comments1":"We live on Hyde Park Crescent and the entrance to our garbage is on Southwick Place so the scheme proposes putting our properties in two different zones and will add considerable inconvenience and long journey times to our home."},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"status":"Strongly \npositive","comments2":"I KNOW IT IS WORKING VERY WELL IN STOCKWELL","hpe":true,"icon":"green","comments1":"VERY HIGH LEVEL OF TRAFFIC ABUSE - SPEEDING/GOING UP ONE WAY ETC - AND TRAFFIC VOLUME IN THE ESTATE \nIT IS A POPULAR RAT RUN"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.17005,51.51609],"type":"Point"}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.17187,51.51503],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"status":"Mostly \nnegative","comments2":"","hpe":true,"icon":"red","comments1":"As a resident of the purple designated area, I feel strongly we should be able to exit the area Northbound onto Sussex Gardens and \nnot be forced to exit to the south onto Hyde Park Pl, which is often 1) difficult to turn onto and 2) highly congested"},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.18193,51.51111]},"properties":{"hpe":false,"comments1":"This scheme is elitist and shameful.

The Council�s website states that each area will have multiple routes in and out. \nHowever the Council�s plan only allows for one exit from the Southern area via Southwick Street. Not only is this contrary to the Council�s states assurance about multiple exits but it is inevitable that this will result in a vast increase in traffic in Southwick Street, which is already constricted as a result of the TFL cycle docking station. \nIn addition the Council�s plan means that residents of Gloucester Square will not have an entrance or exit onto Sussex Gardens. This is an important access point. It is in fact the main access point for Gloucester Square. \nAs a result I object strongly to the Council�s current proposal. As mentioned above I do agree with the scheme in principle but I believe it will only be workable if the following two changes are made to the plan: \n1. The junction at Radnor Place and Sussex Gardens must remain open to allow a second entrance and exit point and maintain the current key access point. \n2. The north side of Gloucester Square, together with Radnor Place, Southwick Place and Radnor Mews should be in the Northern area of the plan. \nNot only would this deliver the Council�s stated objective that the Northern area would then have multiple exits, but it would also mean that residents of Devonport, Somers Crescent and Gloucester Square would be able to park in our own garages and drive to our own front doors.

The scheme appears on the surface to address many concerns that residents and businesses in Paddington have regarding high levels of traffic. \nThe very real problems of traffic management, excess traffic, pollution and congestion and speeding in London are not being addressed. The problems are \nmerely being pushed to the boundaries of the zone being proposed. A piazza in the centre of Connaught village is completely unnecessary and a waste of money and resources. \nWestminster has now introduced a 20 mile speed limit, and I cycle through the zone covering the proposed area, and no traffic complies with the new limit, so why not instead begin by enforcing ? Taxis idling around Paddington station are rife, Ubers parking illegally and stopping in the middle of roads to collect passengers are common. Westminster removed all CCTV cameras several years ago, and reduced simple policing of communities, so taxis loitering, scooters ferrying drugs and other low-life activities are undetected and unenforceable. \nReduction in traffic is no solution. Crime levels will increase and other areas of London are examples of where communities now employ private security firms in lieu of policing . St Johns Wood is a prime example. This is no future for our children. \nThe proposals will not reduce traffic and noise where I live, as traffic routes will be maintained for access to the Hyde Park. The only solution is to reduce the \nnumbers of Ubers and Taxis and improve public transport. \nThe proposals merely create a ghetto and a private, soulless enclave, which has never been the reason for living in London. \nThe whole notion of rat-running must be addressed, but until traffic slow down is enforced this will not happen by blocking streets. \nLTN schemes already implemented in London have faced fierce opposition.

TFL and Westminster City Council, under the direction of Sadiq Khan, have made their main objective to fight the movement of cars, and as such have come up with a variety of schemes to make it as difficult as possible for the flow of cars. The LTN is such a scheme which supposedly is for the benefit of the residents of the Hyde Park Estate (HPE), whilst in reality it creates many problems for the flow of the movement of the residents within and outside the Estate by car. This is something that I am totally against. \n The only possible manner the LTN scheme could be of benefit to the residents of the Estate, that are car drivers too, would be to remove all internal and external blockages of access to the residents, and the non-development of the \"piazza\" through the closure of the 3 roads (Connaught Street, Kendal Street, and Albion Street).
