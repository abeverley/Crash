outside the LTN. For example, I live in St George's Fields (in the ""blue"" zone). Unless I am misreading the map, when coming from

so this would easily add 10 minutes to my journey time; and I can only assume that the congestion around the proposed LTN would be even worse after its implementation. Forcing traffic to take non-direct routes through congested roads seems 
counterproductive to the declared intention of reducing emissions and improving air quality.

It appears to favour Hyde Park gardens and Connaught Street to the exclusion of all other areas in W2. Some might wonder why this is. 
There will be a dramatic increase in traffic the Sussex Gardens and Praed Street Route. These streets are already restricted and congested. 
Conduit Mews being used as a thoroughfare will increase (people using it as a two way street is already unacceptable). 
The taxi rank that has established itself in Praed Street, the width restrictions and deliver scooters and the number of buses make Praed Street a no-go area.

are busier roads than those within the Hyde park estate and in Paddington that need traffic reduction measures more which are more dangerous such as Edgware Road. 
 The scheme that you propose is the same as the one implemented in South Fulham called the SW6 Traffic Reduction Scheme. As someone who works in this area with local residents I have seen it have more negatives than positives with all traffic driven to the surrounding three main roads enclosing the area which increased traffic and made the area very inaccessible to residents who wanted to leave the schemes bubble. I would like to direct your attention to the schemes consultation page on the Hammersmith and Fulham council website and the majority of negative comments it has received from the residents. 
The issue of traffic in our area stems from Crossrail works happening at Paddington station, those using Paddington and the Hyde park as a rat run to avoid the congestion zone and to the motorway. Traffic would be more affectively reduced if the congestion zone was extended to Sussex Gardens. 
Your scheme aims to make the area safer for cyclists however this is contrary to what the plans of the scheme are. You intend to divert 
traffic back to Sussex gardens where there are cycle quiet ways and highways and an increase in traffic will make it more dangerous for cyclists to use these cycle routes. You have also proposed putting a bike shed (?) in an island on Sussex gardens which emphasis the road�s status as a cycle route.

If the scheme were to to go ahead, at the very least we would need a point of entry and exit for ""residents only"" at the top end of Hyde Park Street so that residents of the area designated in purple could access Southwick Street when exiting from or returning to the area via the Sussex Gardens. We would also need a right hand turn coming out of Brook Street into Bayswater Road for residents of the area designated in purple wanting to travel west towards Queensway. Otherwise, we (the residents) will be forced into even worse traffic jams in either Bayswater Road and Sussex Gardens whenever leaving or returning to our homes by car, especially going North or West. 
I would of course favour a reduction in the through traffic, especially the large number of taxis and mini-cabs but not at any price and certainly not at the price of this scheme. Why not instead just block off the traffic from the triangle of streets comprising part of Connaught Street, Kendal Street and Porchester Place. That is where all the shops and restaurants of Connaught Village are, so such a scheme would really enhance Connaught Village. Moreover, such a scheme should stop much of the through traffic, much of which is going East/West along Connaught Street or Kendal Street. Furthermore, such a scheme would be much quicker and easier and cheaper to 
implement.

I regularly ride a motor bike to work in Southwark and at weekends visit elderly parents who live outside London by car and the impact on my journeys will be considerable. 
Based on the plan submitted, the only way to get to Park Lane from Norfolk Crescent is to exit from Southwick Street, go west along Sussex Gardens, around Lancaster Gate and back along Hyde Park Place. There is no other way as there is no right turn into Edgware Road from Sussex Gardens. This is a significant increase to journey times on a regular basis, as even in the early mornings when I travel and there is little traffic on the roads, the number of traffic lights at Lancaster Gate and their phasing causes significant waiting times. 
The only reason this plan is being put in place is due to the congestion caused by the improvements made to Lancaster Gate to accommodate cycle lanes and the traffic looking for alternative 
routes due to the increased time it takes to travel east/west between Marble Arch and Bayswater Road. This congestion has also significantly impacted local residents and our ability to travel around the area by public transport, or car/motorcycle. 
I understand there is increased traffic in the Connaught Village area, but I feel this proposal will result in a negative result for residents who live within the boundary of the LTN.

Naturally these consist of a number of road closures with signs saying ""no entry for vehicles"" etc. As you acknowledge, these signs do not mean what they say because motor vehicles are allowed to access the area and so in very short order everyone will know the score and the signs will have no effect whatever. However, whenever any area is closed down or given restrictions it causes a consequential surge in traffic elsewhere and this leads inevitably to greater congestion and air pollution as all motor vehicles, be they cars, taxis or buses, idle away. 
The rationale of the initiative �to reduce congestion, improve air quality and make it easier and safer for residents to walk and cycle� is simply a chimera: it sounds good but will achieve nothing. 
One of the facts that most city planners seem to ignore is the importance of flowing traffic. As soon as traffic is reduced or removed it facilitates other street crimes, such as mugging, because the life blood is not running through the area. No doubt the trial will go ahead and the City of 
Westminster will spend a lot of unnecessary money on modifying the roads, creating signage etc, all frankly for no good reason. 
The amount of unnecessary expenditure that has already taken place on restructuring the roads, increasing pavements and providing cycle lanes must be an eye watering figure. Clearly the City of Westminster has a responsibility to make things as safe as possible for everyone. In my view, a cycling proficiency test which would cost a fraction of the money you are talking about now would perhaps stop cyclists abusing what they believe is their God given right to disobey the Highway Code.

If the intention is only to restrict these changes to the Cannaught area, whose problems are bound-up with the popularity of the Edgware Road, then I personally would not object. However if these are pilots for the reast of the borough, then the council needs to be careful not to extrapolate its lessons. 
These trials will tell us nothing of what it will be like to extend it to other areas of Westminster or London as a whole. For someone living in them there is only 
upside. They get to continue to use the area as before but they get to use the rest of the borough as before and shut other visitors out by making access more difficult. However people living on the edge of it will see increases in congestion, and people further afield may simply stop visiting or making use of the aminities in the area. 
Slowly closing off sections London will not make London a more liveable city of Londoners, it will atomise the city and make it particularly difficult for those (eg the elderly and those with families) which rely more on private car use than those that do not. 
If the whole of London were split up like this, it would be impossible for those with young children to use schools outside their immediate area. It would make it difficult for them to visit relatives and friends. It would make it difficult for grandparents to visit them at home. 
Westminster council always seemed to exercise more common sense than some other boroughs, so I'm disheartned that it seems to be jumping on the 
same anti-car bandwagon as other councils. Cycling is fine for young single persons, but it simply not realistic for those who are older or have young families, it is also weather dependant.

wanting to go to eastbound to Hyde park street or Albion Street will be FORCED to go via Gloucester Square and north of Hyde Park Square, BY DESIGN. Hence a new rat rut will emerge south of Gloucester Sq into Hyde Park Sq. 
Gloucester Sq and north of Hyde Park Sq have nearly zero traffic today, as evident from the traffic studies shared with us via Hyde Park Estate Association. I do 
find it unacceptable that, a Council endorsed scheme, will make the life of residents worse off BY DESIGN. The principle of the scheme has to be that all residents will be better off or remain the same in 
terms of traffic - as a minimum. It can�t be that some residents will be better off at the expense of others! 
The scheme very cleverly blocks traffic from North to South, particular the heavy traffic flow coming from Paddington. The traffic consultants were at pain to point out that they do not anticipate heavy flows coming from Stanhope Terrace into the estate as shown in their studies. However, if that is the case, why did they make Strathern Place a one way street in the first place? 
As for the argument that cars would not go through the zig zac to avoid a few meters of traffic, the traffic consultants designing the scheme are obviously not driving in London. I am using the Waze App when driving my son to school every day and the app always guides me through elaborate detours to avoid traffic jams; which everyone anticipates to be the norm on Bayswater Rd going forward. 
I urge you to do something about the new rat run on Gloucester Sq/Hyde Park Sq. There are ways to avoid this; for example leave Strathearn Pl as a two way street. I believe that a better measure to reduce the flow of traffic onto Strathern Pl would be to change the green light traffic frequency at Westbourne Terrace for traffic coming into Stanhope Terrace.

Why have 4 lane routes (Bayswater Road, Westbourne Terrace, Sussex Gardens and Lancaster Terrace) been converted into 2 lane routes for very little value for local residents? Why are there 2 lanes for bus stands on Lancaster Terrace? It should have been obvious that the reduction in lane capacity would have serious implications in the area.

I salute the intent of this initiative, and like a lot of what I see. But for one point, i am pleased with this suggestion, but the one point is very important to us. We live on Hyde Park Gardens MEWS. The proposed 
access-only entry on the western end of Hyde Park Gardens, and the one-way flow for Strathearn Place means that there will likely be substantially West to East traffic in Hyde Park Gardens MEWS as motorists subvert the intentions of the initiative. 
I PROPOSE THAT THE WESTERN ACCESS-ONLY BARRIER AT HYDE PARK GARDENS BE CHANGED TO ACCOMMODATE BI-DIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC AND THAT ACCESS-ONLY BARRIERS BE PUT AT BOTH WESTERN ENTRANCES TO HYDE PARK GARDENS MEWS (AT SUSSEX PL AND AT STANHOPE TER). 
Our narrow cobbled mews is home to 8 (soon to be 9) young children, 3 or 4 people who use wheel chairs, and at least 5 dogs. This community has 
really developed over the last few years to be one where we are all looking out for each other, notably through the lockdowns. We have no pavements and 
the southern homes have no back gardens or terraces. Our outdoor space IS the MEWS, and our children, elderly and pets are vulnerable to increased traffic. Increased traffic is a massive safety issue and will have an exceptionally negative impact on our community. My immediate neighbors are 93yo (#41) and 86yo (#7), 5 and 8yo (us, #6) and <2yo (#5). Further, this is the primary route taken by the horses from the stables to the paddock immediately south of Clarendon, which should not be disrupted. 
Any time there has been a modification for road work on Strathearn, Bayswater, Hyde Park Gardens, Clarendon or Brook, we get a *substantial* increase in traffic, with many vehicles traveling at speeds that 
defy safety and ruin community in a mews such as ours...but which might not on a more developed road. Apps such as Waze exacerbate this substantially. 
Hyde Park Gardens, unlike Hyde Park Gardens Mews, has almost nil street life (probably because ALL Hyde Park Gardens residents have access to the massive and lovely private gardens attached to the south) but has exceptionally wide pavements on the south side of the street, and on the north it is just private parking. In fact, this street has a well known problem with prostitution because it is quiet (condoms found all over the treed area across from #10). Some more traffic might actually improve the situation.

The reported intransigence of the Council through its seemingly arrogant and insensitive traffic officials is breath-taking. 
It seems that the questionnaire is more concerned with protecting and �improving� the Village and less with making a safer local neighbourhood. 
The traffic issue could easily be solved by adopting number plate recognition for all vehicles registered in the area. This has been done by other Councils. At the HPEA zoom AGM the answers from a councillor on this issue were unconvincing to do with the cost/hassle of issuing and enforcing penalty charge notices for vehicles not registered to our Area. If other Councils can do it why can Westminster Council not do so? It is surely possible to register the delivery vehicles who need access? It would cut rat running at a stroke, sparing the community all the restrictions and loopholes engendered by the Council�s ill thought out proposal. In passing, it is a shame that this questionnaire could not have been better designed

�rat run� routes between Sussex Gardens and the Bayswater Rd 
I fully understand that these objectives cannot be achieved if there are �unchecked� entry and exit route into the estate in all directions. However, the proposed solutions will cause significant 
inconvenience to residents travelling to and from the estate. I am a resident of Chelwood House in Gloucester Square. In our specific case, the proposed scheme provides reasonable entry and access entry and exit to the South to and from the Bayswater Road. In turn. this provides acceptable access East of the estate. However, the closures of the entrances to the north of Chelwood House at Sussex Gardens means routes North and West are extremely complex and require negotiating the extremely busy Bayswater Road. This is an extremely busy road and will add to congestion. It is clearly a significant inconvenience for Chelwood residents. The nature of the scheme means that other zones have similar, albeit not the same inconveniences. 
This is where innovative thinking should be able to solve the problem. If only residents were allowed to exit the Chelwood zone onto Sussex Gardens, this would remove the possibility of �rat running� yet solve the inconvenience for residents. There are two technologies already available that would provide an automatic system for enforcing resident only use of the exit onto Sussex Gardens. Specifically � a modification of the congestion zone NPR system could be used alongside the planned CCTV cameras. In essence creating a sub zone to provide substantial fining of non-residents using the entry/exit routes into the Estate, a substantial deterrent to any �rat runs� 
� there could be an automatic barrier system which would open by in vehicle wireless transponders only available to residents. This system is used on toll roads all around the world including in the UK. These would eliminate totally the �rat runs� 
Given the intent of the proposals is to provide a permanent solution to this problem, the use of innovative digital technology would achieve the broad aim to reduce traffic in the Hyde Park Estate",Once every two weeks,"Visit bars / pubs /

Under your present plan, it seems impossible for me to drive to St Mary's Hospital, where I am a frequent outpatient. Similarly, the need to drive round three sides of a square to reach my GP is hardly conducive to reducing traffic. 
 Furthermore, it seems from your plan that you propose to block the North entrance of Albion Street, with its two mews and an estate of 300 dwellings.

Gardens/Sussex Place entry/exit.My reasoning is this - the rather ill conceived cycle lane through Hyde Park resulting in a single lane exit at Victoria gate has led to a serious increase in traffic congestion in the park, on Bayswater Road and in the Lancaster gate one way system.Residents returning home and essential delivery vans exiting the A40 flyover at the Paddington exit bound for the Hyde Park estate would normally use Sussex Gardens and then turn right at the traffic lights into Sussex Place thus easing congestion in the Lancaster Gate one way system.If this turn is barred then further traffic congestion will result at Lancaster Gate.

wholeheartedly back the scheme.

Estate. It will create significant knock-on traffic problems, which have not been highlighted. 3. The LTN will significantly increase travel times for shopping and doctors appointments. 4. The principal reason for the recent increase in traffic is directly as a result of creation of cycle lanes on Bayswater Road and closure of North Carriage Drive. 5. Cyclists are causing havoc by riding too fast and jumping red lights and knocking down pedestrians and riding on the pavements and the car lanes despite cycle lanes being empty. There are currently no plans to monitor and implement road traffic rules against cyclists, which should be done."

Charge change could happily use it on the weekends, supporting retail and small businesses in Marylebone and Fitzrovia. If this scheme goes ahead we are confined to just a few streets. Many people park in one of the new zones but live in another. They will have to make longer and extra trips to get to their homes and then to their parking area. I can no longer do a large and heavy shop because I cannot get my car near by so it will mean extra traffic by more delivery vans. I think the scheme will be welcomed if the residents within the new area could move freely through it by means of a permit on proof of residency . Also 
taxis/commercial people carriers should have access to enable people to hail a ride. The culprits using the area as a rat run would not qualify. I am also concerned that new rat runs will appear such as on Albion Street to access the Bayswater Road east via a traffic light system. If the scheme does not allow free movement to residents yet more cars will be forced onto the Bayswater Road / Edgware Road/Sussex Gardens which already suffer from too much slow moving traffic adding to the pollution emanating from those cars to the residents overlooking those streets.

To have to go into the Bayswater Road or Edgware Road to access my home seems nonsensical. Both these roads traffic lanes have been reduced and added to the accepted disaster of the system at Lancaster Gate will only make things worse. There are still rat runs and it means people who have to travel by car to access services like the vets or doctors have to go a hugely circuitous route to get where they need to be.

Other than this I strongly support the scheme.

I do have some concerns that sussex gardens may be overwhelmed with traffic and that cycling into the estate from London Street may become more difficult (i.e the route from Paddington). Previously going straight on here was already hazardous due to no separate stop line for cars and bikes, so now that the bikes can go straight on it would seem that a separate stop line for bikes and probably a light signal for them too may be necessary here.

I live on the western part of the three segments you are proposing and I do find it odd that you have offered to split HPE into two quarters and one half. The half on the 
western side will mean more traffic going south through the exits identified such as Clarendon Place and Hyde Park Street. It 
would make more sense to me to split the western side into a north and south part with the northern part going onto Sussex 
Gardens. I am unsure why you wish to send more traffic from HPE onto Hyde Park Place/Bayswater Road rather than Sussex Gardens. 
I am aware of the Radnor Mews area residents are seeking for a change to the plan to enable them to access through Sussex Gardens by being part of the purple area. Whilst not as equitable as splitting HPE into four (which I think is more appropriate), it at least would mean less traffic from HPE focusing on mainly the two roads south of Hyde Park Street and Clarendon Place (which will be the main two exits for the western part of HPE).

It is patently obvious he wants to have a legacy of being very bicycle friendly and prompting reduction of pollution but the impact of most of this has not been thought through. His plans have created more traffic and pollution on Bayswater Road area. The cyclist having been given total priority over all others and totally abuse additional rights they have been given. Additional bike lanes have improved nothing and most times the cyclists would rather ride on the pavement than use the bike lanes. In the parks the same thing and you take your life in your hands when you walk there now with bikes racing along on pathways that they are not meant to be on. And as for the 20mph speed limit for a car driver that is ridiculous. The bicycles now overtake the cars at that speed but they are not licensed and they can do what ever they want with no repercussions. The problem with car and truck drivers is largely not about absolute speed but bad driving, lane crossing and looking at mobiles whilst in the car. It is also adding to congestion and pollution so what is the point Mr Khan. Oh yes, your legacy. One final thing the withdrawal of bus routes that originally ran direct from Notting Hill area, down Oxford Street to Trafalgar Square or other directions East is a disaster. So how are older people with limited mobility or the disabled meant to get to these destinations now? They can't get down the stairs at undergrounds, they can't afford a taxi, they can't ride a bike and they can't walk very far. And your answer to that is what Mr Khan? All very irritating."

Making a pocket space that blocks traffic at the intersection of Kendal Street, Albion Street and Connaught Street is very welcome, but will continue to be as flawed as the space is at present without consideration to the broader pedestrian experience in Connaught Village. This is currently dominated by parking, with particularly narrow pavements. If the public realm is not addressed holistically, civic life in Connaught Village will continue to not fulfil its potential, and the area will continue to be a way through rather than a destination. Should the pedestrian realm be augmented with widened pavements, reduced on-street parking, and lots of suds planting + a few new trees, then opportunity for businesses, residents and visitors in the area increase exponentially. The option of temporal traffic closure as at Motcomb Street should be explored. This will provide the kind of organic growth that would make future street markets/events etc. exciting and vibrant, rather than a forced gesture.

However, as currently planned the scheme is highly restrictive for residents living in the north east area of the estate where only one two way access via Southwick Street would be in operation. This access would only allow exit by car onto Sussex Gardens from which there is no subsequent right turn into Edgware Road. The scheme would thus make any southbound exit from the estate by residents highly problematic, either forcing residents towards Marylebone (and the current Congestion Charge zone) or via a long route around Lancaster Gate to return to Marble Arch. This issue could be solved by keeping the junction of Norfolk Crescent and Porchester Place open. This amendment should have limited impact on the aim of reducing through traffic because Norfolk Crescent cannot be exited at the north end nor via Burwoord Place nor Cambridge Square. The majority of current through traffic comes up via Hyde Park Street and then around Hyde Park Crescent to Southwick Street. Please take this comment seriously from someone who currently needs to drive to work via Park Lane and thus regularly exit the Hyde Park estate on the south side.","Between three

2.The poor communication means we have been informed by word of mouth - I have lived 20 years on the Hyde Park Estate, am a Director of the 10-72 Sussex Square Residents Association, a Director of the 22-23-24 Hyde Park Square Residents Association, am an active community member and yet received no direct communication. 
4. I have worked as a MRICS in Westminster for 30 years and am very familiar with public realm works and asset management. All requires efficient consultation with all stakeholders equally. I know this as I have been responsible for devising a masterplan for Grosvenor Estate for New Mayfair and Belgravia, also have advised Howard De Walden on retail leasing, and the same for Cadogan Estate. These Estates have very successfully implemented public realm works and local plans for traffic management and high street stimulation. It is not clear how the HPE LTN plan has been arrived at other than it being 'an experiment'. 
5. With the above, I have seen no Traffic Impact Study and no Environmental Impact Study. 6. The consultation with stakeholders must be open and comprehensive and this has not been the case as is evidenced by the tsunami of emails to councillors and between interest groups. The response is one of panic. 
7. This is the worst possible time for an experiment. Not only are there unprecedented levels of stress and hardship with this plan adding an unnecessary level. It is correct to defer the scheme to when there is a proper control for the experiment so Q4 2021 when (i) Covid and work/live routines are normalised and traffic back up to normal levels and (ii) Cross Rail operates. 
8. HPE is home to several characteristic stakeholder groups. An important one which is not having its say is our gulf residential community. I fear they are discriminated against as they are unlikely to be aware of the plans if we the local residents were not. I fear their women are particularly at risk, as mostly they not permitted to drive or walk alone so rely on their drivers and our taxis. Further, there is no tradition of cycling and indeed if you wear a robe you cannot cycle without compromising your safety. Finally, in this crisis, we also do not want their generous spend leaked further to Selfridges or Harrods. If the LTN is implemented they will spend their entire day out 'out' of the estate as coming and going to our local cafes will simply take too long; our neighbours' staff tell us the families may not even come next year and the implementation of a LTN will certainly deter them and they will lead their lifestyle somewhere else.

1. Long tailbacks on Bayswater, Westbourne, Gloucester and Lancaster Terraces, Sussex Gardens, Bishops Bridge Road, Edgware and Marylebone Road 
2. Increased traffic on all roads outside the LTN and rat-running through smaller residential streets across W2 
3. Increased air pollution from standing traffic (as we have seen with West Carriage Drive in Hyde Park) 
4. Displaced traffic will be forced onto recently narrowed roads, adding to existing well-known bottle-necks 
5. Significantly increased road journey times. This scheme particularly discriminates against the less mobile, the elderly and those who must travel by car or bus. It also has a much larger effect on those who have long distances to travel to work and do not have showers and changing facilities 
6. Clogged single lane roads. This means vehicles will be unable to pull over for emergency services (fire, police and ambulance services will suffer) Many cycle lanes are having physical barriers installed. In addition, this scheme means emergency vehicles trying to pass through the HPE to avoid surrounding traffic jams will not be able to pass because of large concrete planters closing roads 
7.

This benefits neither the residents of this part of the scheme, whose journey time by car to access any direction other than South will be so significantly

If the Council really wanted to benefit local residents, they would provide for resident only access through gates like a true residential estate and if this is too difficult to implement for such a large area, then there must at least be access for all residents to all directions via internal connecting routes to exits in each direction which can be traffic calmed via narrowing posts/road humps.

To emphasize as I have stated from the outset, I am not against the Connaught Square piazza concept, improving air quality or reducing the use of the LTN as a vehicle rat run but for the fairly obvious reasons explained, the proposed road closures do not reasonably balance the political the ideology with the fair needs of residents inside or bordering the scheme and are in fact counterproductive even in achieving the stated goal of reducing air pollution.

I also recognise that in order to achieve this I will have to accept some inconvenience to me as a driver of having restricted entry and exit points around the estate, making journey times longer, and I am prepared to do this. However, the current proposal has a number of serious flaws which make it unacceptable to me in its current form. 
1) I live in Somers Crescent in the Northern sector of the three way division of the Estate. The current plan allows only one way out of the Estate for this sector � via Southwick Street, which goes against its overall statement that �each area will have multiple routes in and out�. That route is currently congested and there are frequent backups of traffic in Southwick Street waiting to exit into Sussex Gardens. There are cars parked on both sides of the street, a large cycle rack and a large garage entrance on this street making it difficult for two way traffic to move easily. And this is before making it the only route out of the estate for all of the Northern sector. This is unacceptable. 
2) My house in Somers Crescent has a private garage underneath the house which is accessed only from Southwick Street (in the Northern Sector) and exited only in Radnor Place (in the Western sector) which is left turn only into Sussex Gardens. This means that when I exit the garage I cannot drive to the front of my house to park or pick up people or large items without driving all around the perimeter of the entire area and re-entering the Estate via Burwood Place or Southwick Street. This is ridiculous and unacceptable and goes against the proposal�s statement that �all residents can still drive to and park outside their homes.� 
3) There is only one entrance into Somers Crescent (from Hyde Park Crescent) meaning that every time I drive to the front of my house I will have to do a three point turn in the street to get out again. Also unacceptable. 
4) There is also a potential rat run that is still left open which affects the Northern sector. Vehicles on the Edgware Road wanting to turn into Sussex Gardens either just to avoid congestion on the Edgware Road or to ultimately access the Marylebone Road eastbound, could drive into the Estate at Burwood Place and exit into Sussex Gardens via Southwick Street, using the current rat run on Hyde Park Crescent. No improvement at all to the current situation. 
5) Points 1 � 3 above could possibly be ameliorated by extending the Northern sector westwards to Sussex Place and opening up the entry/exit point at Radnor Place/Sussex Gardens. This would mean that Radnor Place, Southwick Place, Radnor Mews and Gloucester Square (north side) would be in the Northern sector.",Between three and six times a week,"Shop for household essentials (e.g. groceries, pharmacy, DIY, laundry, barber/hair saloon

The Council�s proposal places Gloucester Square in the Southern area of the plan. The Council�s website states that each area will have multiple routes in and out. 
However the Council�s plan only allows for one exit from the Southern area via Southwick Street. Not only is this contrary to the Council�s states assurance about multiple exits but it is inevitable that this will result in a vast increase in traffic in Southwick Street, which is already constricted as a result of the TFL cycle docking station. 
In addition the Council�s plan means that residents of Gloucester Square will not have an entrance or exit onto Sussex Gardens. This is an important access point. It is in fact the main access point for Gloucester Square. 
As a result I object strongly to the Council�s current proposal. As mentioned above I do agree with the scheme in principle but I believe it will only be workable if the following two changes are made to the plan: 
1. The junction at Radnor Place and Sussex Gardens must remain open to allow a second entrance and exit point and maintain the current key access point. 
2. The north side of Gloucester Square, together with Radnor Place, Southwick Place and Radnor Mews should be in the Northern area of the plan. 
Not only would this deliver the Council�s stated objective that the Northern area would then have multiple exits, but it would also mean that residents of Devonport, Somers Crescent and Gloucester Square would be able to park in our own garages and drive to our own front doors.

Why not use the funds to police the area better. Many drug deals in Connaught St, Southwick St. Church Commissioners could lower rents so all premises are occupied and should close down Arvon Court on Titchborne Row. It�s an eyesore with disreputable transient residents."

considerable restriction on availability and access to parking. We have lived in Connaught Village for 16 years. Whilst through traffic has in fact reduced 
significantly in that time - moving the Paddington Station Taxi Rank probably having the greatest positive impact - you need to recognise that this is our choice to live here and one of the key considerations is accessibility. You are imposing a restriction on our ability to travel in our neighbourhood, access local shops, access even the parking spaces in our parking zone. You will be turning Hyde Park Estate into an enclave and we object very strongly to that. 
Furthermore, what are your plans for Hyde Park Place? The congestion there - even during Lockdown when traffic in London has been significantly reduced - is appalling. This scheme will only add to that, and, most importantly, will mean that residents of Hyde Park Estate will have to endure significant inconvenience every time they leave their house to access local amenities and/or want to frankly go anywhere.

What about the residents clean air policy then?? If other locals really do want a greener open space in Connaught Village, then your plan to create 3 enclaves is like cracking a peanut with a sledge hammer! Residents should not be restricted from leaving their neighbourhood via the North exit, East exit, South and West. So treat the area as one - it is by the way one neighbourhood as far as us the Residents are concerned - and seal off the exit of Kendall Street at Connaught Street to create your Piazza.

I purchased our property and moved here with my family in 2018 - and 
I am horrified at how the proposed plan is shown - and what could happen as a consequence! 
The LTN concept /'town planner' ( plan ) has totally negated the fact that row 44 to 50 Gloucester Square, a quiet residential Square and row would become an increased through fare - for cabs, cars, motorbikes, causing extreme disturbance, increasing poor air quality , increasing pollution than there is currently (for a young family ) - points which your LTN concept /'town planner' is 'promoting' that the plan will reduce. 
Furthermore the access to the square opposite our flat , which is frequented by residents often whom are elderly and in the latter part of their lives, would become dangerous, - not to mention it takes away the whole reason of having a garden square which is peaceful and where people can relax who live in the heart of London - without the certain increase in street disturbance and increase in poor air quality / increasing pollution than there is currently. 
Our ground floor / basement flat in row 44 to 50 Gloucester Square was specifically chosen by my wife and I to move to at large financial and physical cost , for my wife's medical condition because of its quietness and the current level of traffic

The speed limit of 20mph should be painted more prominently on the streets, and cameras installed with prominent signs of their presence.

of Gloucester Square. If there is congestion on the Bayswater Road, which is more likely post the scheme, traffic seeking to avoid it will go up Stanhope Terrace onto the south side of Gloucester Square (GS) as Strathearn Place (SP) is one way and around Hyde Park Square in order to exit further down onto the Bayswater Road. Equally this route may also apply to traffic that is unaware of the new road restrictions. GS is currently a reasonably quiet space and has the benefit of a children�s playground in the south side of the square and is used by a lot of families. The potential increase in traffic flow can surely not be an appealing or safe plan. The area and the square suffers from drivers eg, mini-cabs and delivery vans parking up for a break, use the square as a toilet or waiting around to get a fare. The new road proposal may exacerbate this problem. We would like to support the proposal but would like these concerns addressed. A possible solution is to make GS one way in the same direction as proposed for SP and let it remain two way.

I write to confirm receipt of your Paddington and Hyde Park Estate LTN and ETO letter of 07 October 2020. 
I write to confirm that we object to the proposals. The scheme appears on the surface to address many concerns that residents and businesses in Paddington have regarding high levels of traffic. 
The very real problems of traffic management, excess traffic, pollution and congestion and speeding in London are not being addressed. The problems are 
merely being pushed to the boundaries of the zone being proposed. A piazza in the centre of Connaught village is completely unnecessary and a waste of money and resources. 
Westminster has now introduced a 20 mile speed limit, and I cycle through the zone covering the proposed area, and no traffic complies with the new limit, so why not instead begin by enforcing ? Taxis idling around Paddington station are rife, Ubers parking illegally and stopping in the middle of roads to collect passengers are common. Westminster removed all CCTV cameras several years ago, and reduced simple policing of communities, so taxis loitering, scooters ferrying drugs and other low-life activities are undetected and unenforceable. 
Reduction in traffic is no solution. Crime levels will increase and other areas of London are examples of where communities now employ private security firms in lieu of policing . St Johns Wood is a prime example. This is no future for our children. 
The proposals will not reduce traffic and noise where I live, as traffic routes will be maintained for access to the Hyde Park. The only solution is to reduce the 
numbers of Ubers and Taxis and improve public transport. 
The proposals merely create a ghetto and a private, soulless enclave, which has never been the reason for living in London. 
The whole notion of rat-running must be addressed, but until traffic slow down is enforced this will not happen by blocking streets. 
LTN schemes already implemented in London have faced fierce opposition. John Locker, a Conservative councillor in Wandsworth, said: �It is clear that the 
LTNs are not delivering the benefits we want to see. In fact it looks like the combination of changes� are unfortunately having the opposite effect.� The borough scrapped its scheme in September.

I believe it is an infringement on the freedom of movement of us residents, it will create more traffic and pollution in specific points, and is intended to be a source of funding for the council through fines. We live in a city of 8 million, and we have to accept the inconveniences that come with it. TFL and Westminster City Council, under the direction of Sadiq Khan, have made their main objective to fight the movement of cars, and as such have come up with a variety of schemes to make it as difficult as possible for the flow of cars. The LTN is such a scheme which supposedly is for the benefit of the residents of the Hyde Park Estate (HPE), whilst in reality it creates many problems for the flow of the movement of the residents within and outside the Estate by car. This is something that I am totally against. 
 The only possible manner the LTN scheme could be of benefit to the residents of the Estate, that are car drivers too, would be to remove all internal and external blockages of access to the residents, and the non-development of the ""piazza"" through the closure of the 3 roads (Connaught Street, Kendal Street, and Albion Street). The proposed LTN scheme would potentially benefit a small percentage of the people that live in the Estate, whilst vastly inconveniencing the vast majority of them. As a resident of Norfolk Crescent (in the purple area at the top of the Estate) we will be completely isolated, and extremely inconvenienced to access routes that we easily do currently by car. There are 5(!) green circle-signs that would block our movement outside our purple area. There are only 2(!) exit points, one of which is via Park Place West(!), the narrowest street in the Estate. This is UNACCEPTABLE! Furthermore, it will be almost impossible for me to drive to Victoria Gate to enter Hyde Park, which I can easily do now. According to the LTN I would have to get to Sussex Gardens, drive to Lancaster Gate, turn left on Stanhope Terrace and then right on Brook Street. This is absolutely ridiculous! This movement would take so much time, consume fuel, and cause pollution. Similarly, it would be impossible to drive from Norfolk Crescent to Marble Arch, which is currently done by Porchester Place and Connaught Square. Why should we suffer this inconvenience? For what reason? For whose's benefit?! 
 I also believe that we, as residents of Westminster and London, have to facilitate the flow of cars through the Estate, the same way other 
neighbourhoods around the city facilitate the flow of cars through their area (which are beneficial to us when we happen to drive through their area). The 
main culprit for the traffic in the area from Lancaster Gate to Marble Arch, and the surrounding areas, is the completely unnecessary and unwanted interventions regarding cycling lanes, and the",Between three and six times a week,"Shop for household essentials (e.g. groceries, pharmacy, DIY, laundry, barber/hair saloon

This is completely unnecessary. It is rather an effort by Westminster City Council to FOOL the Hyde Park Estate residents to think that it is to their benefit to close the road to facilitate the creation of the ""piazza"". Yes, that area can be made more beautiful and useful, by (as an example) the closing, and pedestrianisation, of Titchbourne Row from 2/3s of the distance from Kendall Street to Oxford Square. Benches and a water fountain would help beautify the spot. 
2) The LTN scheme is a HUGE WASTE of OUR money, when this money can be used instead to provide security to the Estate, by increased Police presence to deal with the drug addicts and peddlers in the area of St John's church, and the various troublemakers off Edgware Road, such as the numerous gypsies. Also to improve the street lighting in the area, including Oxford and Cambridge Squares, and Somers Crescent. The safety of the residents (especially of the children and the elderly) is more important than any traffic-calming scheme. 
3) The government authorities of London, including the unelected people at TFL, should stop pushing their own agendas down the throat of the residents who are paying for their salaries. If we wanted to live in dictatorial environments we would had gone there.

zebra crossing at key points. I would support the idea of looking at additional crossings if there were areas of specific concern. 
I think the limitation of vehicle access will actually materially increase traffic on the border streets and on the routes which remain for access. In turn, in addition to disruptive congestion, this will increase pollution from traffic in these areas. 
Given there is already NOT a traffic or congestion inside within the main areas being proposed for no/extremely limited traffic, this will NOT materially improve air quality and I believe is likely to net negatively affect air pollution due to causing congestion in the routes that remain and surrounding streets. 
I think this plan may severely impair residents ability to travel from their homes to other areas as they desire by their own private car, shared vehicle, or 
taxi. This design means that for the most part people can only exit in a car to one street from their homes. For example, how would you envision someone travel from the Connaught square area heading that needs to head west? 
Our area already has the prime advantage of being on of the only places in Central London that has both LOW traffic in the area and easy access in and out to surrounding areas in most directions. 
Finally I would like to know when you collected the information about residents expressing concern about traffic in the area as I don't believe I've ever received a request for information asking for my views on that.

negative","It is so selfish of the HPE to try wish to impose this scheme, with little or no regard for what happens to pollution and congestion immediately adjacent to LTN. Not in my back yard. Why should we suffer with increased pollution and congestion in other reads around the HPE area. It is also completely unacceptable that this is imposed on this area without proper consultation in the first place. It seems that many residents did not even know about this proposal. Why did Westminster Council not send this to EVERYONE in Westminster Electoral Register? 
We believe that the proposed Hyde Park Estate LTN will result in: 
Long tailbacks on Bayswater, Westbourne, Gloucester and Lancaster Terraces, Sussex Gardens, Bishops Bridge Road, Edgware and Marylebone Road 
Increased traffic on all roads outside the LTN and rat running through smaller residential streets across W2 
Increased air pollution from standing traffic (as we have seen with West Carriage Drive in Hyde Park) 
Displaced traffic will be forced onto recently narrowed roads, adding to existing well-known bottle-necks 
Significantly increased road journey times. This scheme particularly discriminates against the less mobile, the elderly and those who must travel by car or bus. It also has a much larger effect on those who have long distances to travel to work and do not have showers and changing facilities 
Clogged single lane roads. This means vehicles will be unable to pull over for emergency services (fire, police and ambulance services will suffer) Many cycle lanes are having physical barriers installed. In addition, this scheme means emergency vehicles trying to pass through the HPE to avoid surrounding traffic jams will not be able to pass because of large concrete planters closing roads 
It is entirely unfair for a ""gated"" quiet zone to be carved out for a low population enclave compared with much more heavily populated residential streets all around, and at the expense of commuters and less mobile people 
The Council is pushing this though during COVID-19 without any consultation with residents. Only a small group of residents have even been sent the",Less than once a month,"I cut through the area when travelling to
